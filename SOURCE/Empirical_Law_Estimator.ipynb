    "# Empirical Law Estimator: \n",
    "## with highest peak width get $w_0$ and using Gradient algorithm and that, obtain $R_0$\n",
    "This is a notebook to obtain the empirical law that follows the parameter $R_0$ given the estimation by the gravicenter algorithm and the theoretically known $w_0$ and an empirical Law to obtain the $w_0$ parameter if we know the width of the highest peak along the main axis of the CR ring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is the following:\n",
    " - **(1)**: Simulate many many CR rings with different $R_0$ and $w_0$ combinations, fixing the angle at, say, $\\phi_{CR}=0$ and $nx=540$ so we get something similar in resolution to the Basler camera.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **(2)**: For each of the images compute the iX image and run the Gradient Algorithm to estimate the masked gravicenter (which shall be aligned with the gravicenter and the maximum of the ring and spoted in the Pogendorf dark ring). Record in a list the tuples ($D:=$dist(masked_grav,grav), w_0, R_0).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **(3)**: For each image, estimate the width of the highest peak above a certain tolerance of intensity to account for possible backgrounds (which in reality should not be present since they are simulated images, but ok). For this, look for the first pixel that is above the tolerance in the outside part of the big peak and then look for the pixel where there is a second trend change from there, by computing the difference for instance (the differential).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **(4)**: Run two fully connected and two simple regressors to fit each a model for our two objectives. Train the fully connecteds with gradient descent, while the simple multidimensional regressors (1 layer) using the normal equations if possible. Use the L1 norm to avoid unnecessary terms to have weight and get the simplest of the expressions (use also the L2 norm, in case we get a considerably better model).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In order to compute the $w_0$ from the width of the highest peak, we could introduce also the data of the $D$ in order to give more flexibility to the model (try both things). For obtaining $R_0$ then use both the estimated $w_0$ and the $D$.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **(5)**: Save the trained models, and make a section where we can input experimental images and obtain automatically (or manually, since maybe the noise now gives us strange things) the width of the highest peak and with it $w_0$ and then $R_0$ with the gradient algorithm estimate."
