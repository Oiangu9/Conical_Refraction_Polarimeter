 Please see the pictures attached. These are taken with no sample and no polarizer to see the intensity uniformity and ging quality. The 3D plot is generated by the ImageJ program using a bit of smothing. The intensity variations around the ring seem to rotate as the crystal is rotated. Winder why the crystal is casuing such irregular intensity variations. I will try the second crystal next week.

 

Thanking you,
